VARIABLE ATTRIBUTES 
----------------------
  
	Variable attributes are used in place of datatypes in variable declaration or procedure parameter declaration in pl/sql block.
	There are two types of variable attributes supported by pl/sql .
1)COLUMN LEVEL ATTRIBUTES
2)ROW LEVEL ATTRIBUTES 

COLUMN LEVEL ATTRIBUTES
	In this method we are defining attributes for individual columns 
	This attribute is represented using %type

SYNTAX:
   	Variable_Name Table_Name.Column_Name%TYPE;

EXAMPLE:
DECLARE 
   V_NAME EMP.ENAME%TYPE ;
   V_SAL EMP.SAL%TYPE ;
BEGIN 
    SELECT ENAME ,SAL INTO V_NAME ,V_SAL 
    FROM EMP 
    WHERE EMPNO=&NO ;
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(V_NAME || ' ' || V_SAL);
END ;
/
 ROW LEVEL ATTRIBUTES '
-----------------------
	In this method a single variable represents all different datatypes in entire row in a table that’s
	Why this variable is also called as record type variable in this variable is represent using %rowtype.
 SYNTAX:
   Variable_Name Table_Name%Rowtype;
EXAMPLE :
Write a pl/sql programm to display name ,job and salary of the employe get the values from user as empno.
DECLARE 
    I EMP%ROWTYPE ;
BEGIN 
   SELECT ENAME,JOB,SAL INTO I.ENAME ,I.JOB,I.SAL
   FROM EMP 
   WHERE EMPNO=&NO ;
     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME || ' ' || I.JOB ||' '  || I.SAL);
END ;
/
Write a pl/sql programm to display name ,job and salary of the employe get the values from user as empno.
EXAMPLE :
DECLARE 
    I EMP%ROWTYPE ;
BEGIN 
    SELECT * INTO I
    FROM EMP 
    WHERE EMPNO=&NO ;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(I.ENAME || ' ' || I.JOB ||' '  || I.SAL);
END ;
/
